Question Generation for MyLearn
===============================

The function `exams2mylearn` in `exams2mylearn.R` can generate multiple-select questions with a simple feedback option in Learn's import format.
The imported questions can be organized into exams in the Learning Activities.

Dependencies:
* libxml2 (it was on my Ubuntu by default)
* pandoc
* recent R version

The question import functionality has to be turned on by the Learn development team per course.
Their address is "learn" at "wu" dot "ac" dot "at".

Demo
----

One creates an `R/exams` compatible exercise file similar to `example_question.Rmd`, decides for a name prefix and for the number of generated exams.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("exams2mylearn.R")
n <- 100L  # number of variants of the exercise
name <- "learn_exercise"  # prefix of the generated file names
exercise_file <- "example_question.Rmd"
output <- exams2mylearn(filename = exercise_file,
                        name = name,
                        n = n)
```

The output zip file is `output`.
One can upload that zip file to Learn directly (after the Learn development team has activated that feature for the given course).
