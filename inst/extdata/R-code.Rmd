Question
========
Some R code:

Some German characters äößü

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dat <- 1:20
s <- 0
for (i in seq_along(dat)) {
  s <- s + dat[i]
}
```

Inline `R` code: <code>calc_rule(dat, k)</code>, and now a block of `R` code:

    hist(dat, breaks = n)
    var(dat)
    myfun <- function (a) {
      mean(a)
    }
Some invalid `R` code but still in typewriter font is <samp>data1</samp>.


Answerlist
----------
* Another, a bit more tedious way to show `R` code could be<br/>
<pre> a &lt;- 1:10 <br/>
print(a) </pre>

* For some reason, code in the answerlist only works if it's already formatted as HTML
* Three
